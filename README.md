# What is TypeScript?

## JavaScript that scales

**TypeScript is built and maintained by Microsoft. Microsoft's strapline for TypeScript is JavaScript that scales because it helps write large JavaScript based programs.**

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
- Any feature in JavaScript is available in TypeScript.
- TypeScript adds a powerful type system to the JavaScript we already know and love.
- This type system enables code editors to provide code refactoring and navigation features along with type checking.
- TypeScript helps a JavaScript codebase become more readable and easier to maintain by adding a static type system.

- TypeScript doesn't directly execute in the browser.
- Like JSX, it needs to be converted to JavaScript first.
- TypeScript has a compiler that can do this after type checking the code.
- The Babel compiler can convert TypeScript code to JavaScript as well.
- TypeScript is not limited to browser-based apps. It can be used on the backend as well to write nodejs based apps.


## TypeScript usage

### Mature and still rapidly developing

- Typescript was first released in 2012 and so is very mature now.
- It is still rapidly developing, with at least one release per month.

## Powerful and flexible type system

- The type system is super flexible, which is essential for writing generic and reusable code.
- Both Angular and Vue are now using TypeScript to build their frameworks, highlighting just how flexible it is. It also works brilliantly with React!
- Migrating to TypeScript from JavaScript can be a gradual process.
- This is because types in TypeScript are optional, and every JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file.
- The TypeScript compiler's strictness is also configurable so that the codebase types can be strengthened over time.

## Huge community

- TypeScript has a big community that is still growing.
